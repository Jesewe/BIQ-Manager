# Binary Injection and Querying Manager (BIQ-Manager)

The Binary Injection and Querying Manager (BIQ-Manager) is a project designed to facilitate the process of injecting DLL (Dynamic Link Library) files into Windows processes and performing various querying operations on them. It provides a convenient interface for managing the injection process and interacting with the injected DLLs.

## Features

- **DLL Injection**: BIQ-Manager allows you to easily inject DLL files into running Windows processes, enabling you to extend the functionality of those processes.
- **Querying Capabilities**: Perform queries and operations on the injected DLLs within the target processes, such as retrieving data, executing custom functions, or modifying the behavior of the target process.
- **Process Management**: Gain control over the targeted processes, including starting, stopping, and monitoring their activities.
